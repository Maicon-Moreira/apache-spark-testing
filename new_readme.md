<br>

This is a repo that i will experiment and test features and functions of <strong>SQL</strong>

This repository contains global tests and tests for specific languages.

The tests are written in <strong>JavaScript</strong>.

# Interesting things I did üéà

- simple-postgres-crud
  - This is a simple server to test actions like `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, also known as CRUD.
  - It is really basic, but it is enough to test the basic functions of SQL.
    <br>
    <br>
- simple-postgres-relation
  - This is a simple server to test relations between tables.
  - In this example I test the `JOIN` function, with the tables `users` and `houses`.

## TODO üìö

- implement more complex relations
- test performance
- `sql-testing` in other languages other than `javascipt`
