This is a repo that i will experiment and test features and functions of <strong>Apache Spark</strong>

This repository contains global tests and tests for specific languages.

The tests are written in <strong>Python</strong>.

# Interesting things I did 🎈

- simple_json_to_csv
  - This is a simple example of how to convert a json file to a csv file using Spark.
  - It is really basic, but it shows fundamental concepts, such as:
    - Schemas
    - Dataframes
    - Spark SQL

## TODO 📚

- implement more complex transformations
- test performance
- `apache-spark-testing` in other languages other than Python
